#### Subject: Optimal framework for computing similarities based on dictionaries


### About
------
##### My thesis proposed a faster way to compute Normalized Compression Distance by using different approaches.
##### 1. Paralelization of Complearn Tool.
##### 2. Try my own version of implementation for FCD (Fast Compression Distance).
##### 3. Using GPU based compression. For this approach was chosen nvcomp library.
