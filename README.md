# Bachelor Thesis

### Description
#### :school: Military Technical Academy "Ferdinand I", Bucharest
#### Subject: Optimal framework for computing similarities based on dictionaries


### About
------
##### My thesis proposed a faster way to compute Normalized Compression Distance by using different approaches.
##### 1. Paralelization of Complearn Tool.
##### 2. Try my own version of implementation for FCD (Fast Compression Distance) - https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/30997967.pdf.
##### 3. Using GPU based compression. For this approach was chosen nvcomp library.


### Publication
------
##### There is an article published regarding some of the work. Check this out!

### Future work
------
##### Future work involves creating an API in Flask to make the methods available for free usage. This API can be used with for now with images, but can be expanded to support any type of file. There will be created an option for everyone to be able to implement their own serializers.
##### If you need any help regarding this usage, please let me know.
